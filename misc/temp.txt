In the context of EBCDIC, SEL (Select) is a control character, typically used for device or  system-specific
operations. It  does not  represent a  printable character  and is  reserved for  internal or protocol-based
communication, such as selecting a device or signaling a specific action.

SEL in Modern Contexts

When  converting  EBCDIC  to  Unicode,  SEL  does   not  have  a  direct  equivalent,  as  its   meaning  is
context-dependent. If required for interoperability,  it may be mapped to  a private-use area in Unicode  or
simply ignored, depending on the application.

In the context of EBCDIC CCSID  875, RNL stands for Required New  Line. It is typically a control  character
used in printing or formatting to indicate the need for starting a new line.

In Unicode, RNL (Required New  Line) does not have a  direct equivalent code point because  Unicode does not
define a specific character for RNL. Instead, Unicode provides general newline-related characters, such as:

U+000A (LF - Line Feed): Typically used for line breaks.

U+000D (CR - Carriage Return): Often combined with LF in CRLF sequences.

U+0085 (NEL - Next Line): Used as a newline character in some EBCDIC systems and environments.

Since RNL is specific to EBCDIC and certain  legacy systems, its behavior can be approximated in  Unicode by
U+0085 (NEL), which  is often used  to represent similar  concepts when converting  from EBCDIC to  Unicode.
However, the exact mapping might vary depending on the context and the system performing the conversion.
